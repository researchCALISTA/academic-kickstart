<!--
We possess a unique dataset currently consisting of about 100.000
mobile (77 thousands of 3G and 23 thosands 4G) antennas,
yielding approximately 10000 spatially separated  masts.
-->

We also know "the history of antennas" and can visualize how the population of
antennas evolve  in time, providing mobile network coverage to the whole
country.

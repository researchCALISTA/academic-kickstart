My primary research interest is oriented towards Spatial Analysis and GIS, software development and quantitative analysis in population and economic geography with special focus on demography and migration, school choice and labour market opportunities, and more recently also the geography of human interaction on the Internet and through mobile phone usage.

I am the administrator of the Uppsala University located PLACE database. PLACE is a Statistics Sweden (SCB) compiled database containing longitudinal and geocoded statistics on individual level between 1990 and 2017. PLACE is used by researchers with an interest oriented towards quantitative research, spatial analysis and GIS.

My software project EquiPop (EquiPop is a software-program developed for the calculation of k-nearest neighbourhoods/contexts) is specifically designed to work with datasets that contain thousands or millions of observations and offers viable solutions to Knn questions also where large areas and complex geographies are involved.) EquiPop can be downloaded from this webpage: https://equipop.kultgeog.uu.se/

International academic engagements and activities include membership in the newly formed Regional Science Academy and frequent participation in activities arranged by NECTAR and RSAI/ERSA/NARSC.

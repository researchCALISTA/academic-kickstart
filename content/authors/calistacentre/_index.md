## The vision

We aim to get researchers together from different disciplinesto study the pulse of the urban landscape acrossultiple temporal scales through a multitude of theories, methods and data sources.

## Our goals

1. To facilitate applied research in regional science with a specific focus on spatio-temporal relationships at an extensive micro-level.

2. To promote the use of Big Data methods and the use of combined datasets from a variety of fields in societal research through interdisciplinary cross-pollination.

3. To study processes of socio-economic characteristics as well as mobility and flows of individuals, ideas, capital, vehicles, etc. with a particular focus on urban processes.

4. To understand the role of different levels of time and space ranging from individual, neighbourhood, urban area to region as well as minutes, hours, days, weeks, months and years.

5. To generate theory, methods and findings that can be applied in society and that is policy relevant
